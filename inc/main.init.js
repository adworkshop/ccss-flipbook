Through three signature programs\u2014Collaborative Projects, Faculty Fellows, and Small Grants\u2014the ISS encourages research, including quantitative, qualitative, and computational social science studies. We also advance interdisciplinary collaborations through forums, such as workshops and informal lunches, where research findings and methods are discussed and new research projects are cultivated. The ISS fosters systematic, evidence-based, and collaborative research studies addressing important disciplinary and public policy concerns. The organization recognizes the critical value of basic research in the social sciences and strives to cultivate world-class scholarship that contributes to our fundamental understanding of the social world. Consistent with Cornell\u2019s mission as a land-grant institution, the ISS disseminates knowledge in service to the public good. OVERVIEW INSTITUTE THE \f",

        "4": "The Provost has challenged Cornell\u2019s faculty to consider new research and training that embraces the idea of \u201cradical collaboration.\u201d For the ISS and the social science research community, this means engaging with Cornell\u2019s faculty in the natural and physical sciences. This is a challenging but important endeavor. Addressing contemporary environmental and health issues, for example, requires more than technical fixes. Global climate change portents new population responses to rising sea levels and record temperatures, unavoidable commercial adaptations to declining crop yields and pestilence, and the prospect of new regional conflicts involving scarce resources or refugees. Promoting population health and effective medical interventions requires expertise on the cost-effective organization of health care delivery systems and on health care access and utilization. It also requires some understanding of health behaviors, including smoking, diet, and risky behaviors (e.g., abusing opioids). The adoption and diffusion of new technological innovations has a large behavioral component that requires\u2014perhaps more than ever\u2014the expertise of Cornell\u2019s social and behavioral sciences. The ISS embraces the need for disciplinary-based research and training at Cornell. But it also envisions new research at the boundaries between traditional academic disciplines, both within and outside the social sciences. This annual report describes two new collaborative research projects focused on the technological changes in information and computer sciences. One project addresses new digital technologies and social media and the implications for prosocial behavior, cyberbullying, and fake news. The other collaborative project deals with the rise in \u201cbig data\u201d and computer algorithms (e.g., machine learning) that affect hiring and promotion decisions that benefit some groups at the expense of others. Cultural and social change usually lags behind technological change. The ISS is well positioned to contribute to Cornell\u2019s diverse and evolving program of research and training in the social sciences\u2014and its connection to other disciplines and programs of research across the Ithaca and NYC campuses. Sincerely, Daniel T. Lichter Robert S. Harrison Director ISS DIRECTOR DANIEL T. LICHTER Since summer 2015, Daniel T. Lichter has served as the Robert S. Harrison Director of theInstitutefortheSocialSciencesatCornell. The Ferris Family Professor of Life Course Studies in policy analysis and management in the College of Human Ecology, Lichter also holds a faculty appointment in sociology in the College of Arts and Sciences. Lichter publishes widely on population and public policy, including studies of concentrated poverty and inequality, intermarriage, immigrant incorporation in American society, rural sociology, and American racial and ethnic transformation. Prior to coming to Cornell in 2005, he was on the faculty at Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. He received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Friedman received a grant from the Cornell East Asia Program on \u201cTechnology and Work in China.\u201d ($17,500). NEW FUNDING The China\u2019s Cities project, led by Jeremy Wallace (Government), investigates developments in China\u2019s urbanization. Our research has two emphases: first, on the divisions inside and across Chinese cities and facing their residents, and second, the government\u2019s plethora of plans to manage the growth of urban people and space. Our multi-disciplinary team uses a range of methodologies, including ethnography, large-scale administrative data, satellite imagery, surveys, and experimental methods. In 2018-19, the China\u2019s Cities team completed year three of its collaborative project. We held our capstone lecture on March 22, 2019. After being introduced by Associate Vice Provost for the Social Sciences, Chris Wildeman, and ISS Director Dan Lichter, each team member presented various subprojects and described future research trajectories to the fifty people in attendance. The project\u2019s publications list include over 20 articles, and many more are on the way. In 2018-19 in particular, Eli Friedman published \u201cJust-in-Time Urbanization\u201d in Critical Sociology, which argues that large Chinese cities have, like Toyota\u2019s just-in-time production system, sought to avoid the costs of \u201cwarehousing\u201d surplus populations, granting access to local citizenship and public education for migrants and their children only if they fulfill a specific need in the labor market. The article also represents the core of Friedman\u2019s current book project, which has seen significant progress in the current academic year. In early 2019, a major investment of the grant support finally came through to produce returns. The project fundedasurveyexperimentonanationally-representative urban sample of over 3,000 individuals in China\u2019s cities, and the results of that survey came in, a bit later than expected, in January 2019. Wallace and Jessica Weiss, joined by Government Ph.D. candidate Lincoln Hines, are in the midst of analyzing the data and reporting on the results via multiple journal articles. Weiss also is leading a team funded by the Cornell China Center to analyze survey and discourse data on public opinion in urban China. Shanjun Li\u2019s research on China\u2019s automotive sector continued to bear fruit as well, with publications in Comprised of five Cornell social science faculty members, collaborative projects conduct research on cutting-edge social science issues or topics.

A working paper by Barwick and Li using their massive credit card data analyzing the morbidity cost of air pollution received public attention through a piece published at VoxEU and VoxDev in September 2018 and January 2019, respectively. As the team finishes its funded term, we continue to develop our research projects on China\u2019s cities. In addition to the projects mentioned above, Li and Wallace are moving forward on two papers related to the political economy of China\u2019s secondary market for cars and air pollution standards, Wallace and Government PhD student Shiqi Ma are analyzing Beijing\u2019s 2017 slum demolition, and Barwick and Li are working on numerous big data papers related to Chinese industrial policy, air pollution\u2019s health effects, and transportation infrastructure. \f",
        "8": "KEY PUBLICATIONS The proliferation of algorithms is reconfiguring our socio- economic systems in profound and complex ways. This collaborative project, led by Martin Wells (Statistics and Data Science), brings together scholars from across the social sciences to critically examine the design, understanding, and use of algorithmic systems. The researchers share a concern with how the concomitant rise of big data, machine learning, and digital surveillance has the potential to exacerbate social inequalities among vulnerable communities. The proposed program of research will therefore develop a more holistic understanding of algorithmic bias across disciplinary boundaries and within such empirical domains as work\/ employment, finances\/creditworthiness, health, and social media. Through such research, we aim to understand\u2014 and ultimately challenge\u2014the kinds of data-driven inequality and discrimination that are defining social life in the algorithmic age. Ifeoma Ajunwa (ILR School) and Martin Wells\u2019 Mapping the Eco-system of Hiring Platforms project will interview the developers of hiring platforms and create a network view of the end users and saturation by industry\/field. Wells and colleagues are developing statistical methods for estimation of causal effects from observational data and are applying these methods to assessing various fairness measures in machine learning. This approach to causal inference formulates the distinction between associational and causal concepts in terms of underlying joint distributions. Solon Barocas (Information Science) along with Cornell graduate student Manish Raghavan (Computer Science) and Professors Karen Levy (Information Science) and Jon Kleinberg (Computer and Information Science) are investigating the practices of an emerging set of companies that specialize in algorithmic pre-employment assessments, with the goal of establishing what companies mean when they assert that their tools reduce or eliminate bias from the hiring process. Brooke Erin Duffy (Communication) and Cornell students Annika Pinch (Psychology) and Shruti Sannon (Communication) are collaborating on a study examining the impact of algorithmic systems on work in the media and creative industries. Through in-depth interviews with online content creators and gig workers, their study shows how cultural producers respond to the demands of algorithmic learning to achieve efficiencies of work. Malte Ziewitz (Science & Technology Studies) and organization studies scholar Maximilian Heimst\u00e4dt have been following recent attempts in New York City to introduce legislation for algorithmic accountability. In 2018, Ajunwa and Wells received an ILR School theme grant on Technology and Work ($20K). Ajunwa\u2019s NSF CAREER Award proposal, \u201cThe Development, Design, and Ethical Issues of Algorithmic Hiring Tools\u201d was recommended for funding in the amount of $526,877. Ziewitz received an NSF CAREER Award for a project on \u201cUnderstanding and Advancing Fair Representation in Algorithmic Systems\u201d ($400,300). Ziewitz and Stephen Hilgartner have been awarded $178,361 by the Cornell Data Science Curriculum Initiative to establish the \u201cData Science & Society Lab.\u201d Wells\u2019 research has been supported by an NSF grant ($150,000) \u201cVariable Selection When P>>N: Beyond the Linear Regression and Normal Errors Model\u201d and a Department of Labor grant ($244,603) \u201cCriminal Record Inaccuracies and the Impact of a Record Education Intervention on Employment-Related Outcomes.\u201d Barocas and Cornell colleagues received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to support a new initiative on Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice ($900,000).

Sharing Fake News on Social Media: Understanding the Relationship Between Believe and Share Presented at the 69th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association KEY PUBLICATIONS The Prosocial Behaviors in the Digital Age Project, co- led by Natalie Bazarova (Communication) and Drew Margolin (Communication), seeks to understand prosocial behaviors through the lens of digital technologies. This collaborative project is focused on encouraging prosocial behaviors online, which include, but are not limited to, bystander interventions, the correction of false information, and online peer support to those in distress and needing help. In addition to exploring ways to encourage prosocial behaviors, this interdisciplinary team seeks to examine and leverage theoretical mechanisms through which online anti- social behaviors can be reduced. Bazarova, Dominic DiFranzo (Communication), and Janis Whitlock (BCTR), along with collaborators Amanda Purington and Yoon Choi, are currently building interactive modules for the Social Media TestDrive, an innovative online platform for digital literacy education in youth. They have partnered with Cornell PRYDE and Common Sense Education in developing, evaluating, and disseminating TestDrive modules. Margolin and Whitlock have been leading the project\u2019s efforts to develop a new grant proposal to support a study of false information dissemination on social media, with a focus on how to find effective ways for individuals to correct false information posted online. Their approach focuses on the tension between the pro-social benefit of making information more accurate and the potentially anti-social cost of creating hostile, conflict-oriented discourse online. Vanessa Bohns (Organizational Behavior) and Rene Kizilicec (Information Science) have been working to determine best directions for the review paper focusing on prosocial behaviors and empathy. Two research questions have been posed: 1) What factors influence whether people respond to a moral violation with empathy for the person who has been harmed vs. moral outrage at the person who has done the harming? 2) Do people underestimate the efficacy of empathy expressions? DiFranzo, Bazarova, and Katherine Miller (Communication), are working together to coordinate a workshop for the Truman platform, which is an open source, complete social media simulation platform for experimental research that is freely available for researchers. Additionally, DiFranzo and Bazarova, along with Philipp Masur, a visiting scholar from Germany, are in the process of completing a three-phase study of social norms and digital literacy on privacy and disclosure in social media. In 2018, Margolin was awarded a grant for the \u201cSocial Connections to Local Food Produces Using Immersive and Non-Immersive Video\u201d project, in the amount of $151,145. Bazarova and Whitlock were awarded $500,000 for the \u201cLeveraging Social Media TestDrive and Digital Citizenship Curriculum for Kids and Schools\u201d project by The James and Rebecca Morgan Fund to support a partnership with Common Sense Media. Bohns was awarded $250,855 for \u201cPsychological Assessment of Voluntary Consent,\u201d as a co-principal investigator, with PI Roseanna Sommers.

        "11": "On October 4, 2018, the ISS Mass Incarceration Project hosted Professor James Forman, Jr., Yale Law School and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, for the project\u2019s capstone lecture. Forman\u2019s lecture, \u201cLocking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,\u201d examined the social and economic roots of mass incarceration and how society can stop their spread. This event also kicked off a legacy of the project: an annual lecture on the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, co-sponsored by Cornell\u2019s Center for the Study of Inequality. On February 11, 2019, the ISS brought Mahzarin Banaji, Richard Clark Cabot Professor of Social Ethics and Chair in the Department of Psychology, Harvard University, to speak on the topic of implicit bias. Banaji\u2019s talk served as both the 3rd annual ISS Distinguished Lecture in the Social Sciences and the Robert L. Harris Jr. ADVANCEments in Science Lecture, supported by the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity. The Department of Psychology Colloquium and the Center for Bright Beams also sponsored the event. A standing-room only crowd from all corners of the university attended Banaji\u2019s lecture titled \u201cBlindspot: The Hidden Biases of Good People,\u201d which explored the disparities between conscious expressions of values, attitudes, and beliefs, and less conscious, implicit representations of mental content. Banaji\u2019s work emphasizes the possibility that values and aspirations can be inconsistent with behavior. It is difficult, but people\u2019s attitudes can change when they purposefully think new thoughts that oppose an existing association. In its third year, the Postdoctoral Social Scientists\u2019 Working Group has grown to 22 members. This group is co-sponsored by the ISS, Cornell Population Center, Center for the Study of Inequality, and the Bronfenbrenner Center of Translational Research. It fosters the development of work in progress and research collaborations through weekly writing sessions and monthly lunch meetings. Participating postdoctoral associates represent many disciplinary-diverse units across campus, including the co- sponsoring units, as well as Anthropology, the Atkinson Center of a Sustainable Future, Communication, Government, Jewish Studies, Law, Policy Analysis and Management, Psychology, the SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Science and Technology Studies, and Sociology. 10 BRIDGES BUILDING The ISS hosts lectures, workshops, and other public events aimed at building intellectual bridges across the social sciences, while reaching out to a broader public audience.
